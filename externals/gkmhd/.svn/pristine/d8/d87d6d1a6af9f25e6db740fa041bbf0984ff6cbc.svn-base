GKMHD -- a tokamak MHD equilibrium model solving the Grad-Shafranov equation
by B Scott Jan 2010

iterates between solving Ampere's law for psi given jphi and pressure profiles
and then moving the grid flux surfaces to align with surfaces of constant psi

the normalised coordinate is usually rho pol although you can change this in the
input xml file

the grid is a structured array of triangles in which each grid surface is expected at
convergence to align with the given flux surface

the output is given in SFL coordinates (see ITM Conventions)

the GK means gyrokinetic though that has proven to be optimistic
eventually I would like to have a simultaneous gyrokinetic and MHD equilibrium
