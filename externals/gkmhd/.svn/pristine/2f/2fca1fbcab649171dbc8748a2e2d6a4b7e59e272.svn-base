SVN revision 20 did the following:

incorporate equpdate and eqpostdate into the build and fc2k system
these actors are now bundled with gkmhd

SVN revision 15 did the following:

update trunk to new actor release system
it should simply require ./build.sh to make the library
and fc2k -gui fc2k/gkmhd.xml to make the actor

old Makefile is in Makefile_orig
the new one is for this system only and strips redundant elements

changes to the code itself were minimal -- just had to add
USE L3interps in several places in three routines:
metric, dwaux, and putequil
