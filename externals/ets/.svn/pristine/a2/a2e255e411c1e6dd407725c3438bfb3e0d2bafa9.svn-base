This README describes the version of the code implementing a coupling
of the ETS and an equilibrium code.

The main code is "eq_ets_test" but "write_input" needs to be run
(once) before running "eq_ets_test".

The cases inly run with the UAL.

"write_input" (run with "make write_input") writes to shot 5, run 1
values of coreprof, coresource, coretransp, coreimpur and equilibrium
that are used by "eq_ets_test".

"eq_ets_test" (run wuth "make eq_ets_test") reads data written by
"write_input" and produces a new shot/run containg the results (as
well as local files in "eq_ets_data/OUTPUT").

Input for "eq_ets_test" is from "eq_ets.xml".

Available options for SYS are

g95_UAL
g95_UAL.local
GRID_UAL.local
GW_UAL
GW_UAL.local
linux.Fujitsu.debug_UAL.local

When running remotely, the environment variable "euitm_path" will need
to be set appropriately --- see "README.MDSPLUS".
