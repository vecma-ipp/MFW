This README describes the version of the code implementing analytic
test cases using thye method of manufactured solutions.

The main code for this is "solver_test" and this can be run sith and
without the UAL.

"make" by itself will attempt to compile and run "solver_test" using
the default compiler choice (to see what this is, type "make SYS").

Available SYS options include

g95
g95_32
g95_UAL
g95_UAL.local
gfortran
gfortran_32
GRID
GRID_UAL.local
GW
GW_UAL
GW_UAL.local
JET
linux.Fujitsu
linux.Fujitsu.debug
linux.Fujitsu.debug_UAL.local
linux.Intel
linux.Intel64
linux.Nag

Options with "UAL" use the UAL for output (in addition to the files
produced in "data/OUTPUT").

Options with "UAL.local" compile the UAL locally, enabling the code to
be run outside of the Gateway.  This does, however, require a recent
local compilation of MDSplus.

When running remotely, the environment variable "euitm_path" will need
to be set appropriately --- see "README.MDSPLUS".

Input for the code comes from "ets_analytics.xml".
