This document will describe the local installation of MDSPLUS and
options for running various codes using the UAL on machines other than
the Gateway.

If you want to write using the UAL to local files, you will need to have the
"MODEL_TREE" information (stored in "MODEL_TREE") and to set the "euitm_path"
environment variable:

setenv euitm_path "$PWD/MDSPLUS;$PWD/MODEL_TREE"

If you want to use data on the Gateway, you will need to start an mdsip server
on one of the login nodes, and then set the path approriately:

setenv euitm_path "enea142.efda-itm.eu::/pfs/work/imp3/coster/itmdb/itm_trees/test/4.06d/mdsplus/0;enea142.efda-itm.eu::/pfs/itmdb/itm_trees/public/models/4.06d/mdsplus"

The above line assumes:
  the server was started on enea142
  your public UAL directory is
  "/pfs/work/imp3/coster/itmdb/itm_trees/test/4.06d/mdsplus/0;enea142.efda-itm.eu" 
  the public UAL directory (containing the MODEL_TREE) is
  "/pfs/itmdb/itm_trees/public/models/4.06d/mdsplus"
Appropriate substitutions will need to be made if this is not the case!
