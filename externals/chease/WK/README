To run Chease from an EXPEQ file as EXPEQ_50555t63.95 in this directory:

run.chease.expeq 50555t63.95 dir_in dir_out [pfactor peop]

thus:
run.chease.expeq 50555t63.95 . .

then output in dir_out/o.50555t63.95

One should get the same as o.50555t63.95.example

Plots using matlab:
matlab
addpath('../matlab')
Chease_Plot (from Zabiego, modified)
shot: 50555
time: 63.95

Change input data in run.chease.expeq to run chease differently, for example

To make use of the profile file, change:
NBSEXPQ=0000,
to
NBSEXPQ=1111,

where the first 1 means Te is given in EXPTNZ file, the second, ne, the 3rd Zeff, the fourth Ti. I am working on taking ni as well.

running a test case:

cp EXPEQ_50555t63.95 /tmp/sauter/EXPEQ
cp EXPTNZ_50555t63.95 /tmp/sauter/EXPTNZ
cp chease_namelist_EXPEQ /tmp/sauter/chease_namelist
cd /tmp/sauter
cat chease_namelist > o.test50555
chease >> o.test50555

testing
o.chease_to_cols o.test50555 o.test50555.cols
matlab
>> plotdatafile
o.test50555.cols

Chease in Kepler: 2010 March 23
Starting with version equiv to tag 7_5 it starts working
Has added p
Now needs to not read in EXPEQ file etc.
take shot=191 and run=11 as starting value

To get various quantities at specific q values:

In namelist:
NEONBQS (nb of q surfaces, by default 2+5 values)
QVALNEO (q values, by default: on-axis, 1., 1.5, 2., 3., 4., edge; specify QVALNEO=0.,1., 1.5, 2., 3., 4.,0.)

Note that there is already just above the output on integer q surfaces for sawtooth related quantities in particular like li
They are from DIAGARS(..,IDIAGLAS+j)
