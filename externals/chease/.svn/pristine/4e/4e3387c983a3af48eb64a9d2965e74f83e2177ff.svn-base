The computer code CHEASE is developed at the Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (CRPP/EPFL), Switzerland. 

CHEASE is an accurate fixed boundary equilibrium solver, flexible and designed to produce interface with many different codes.

CHEASE is an open-source code available only for non-commercial usage. The present user can run CHEASE under the additional conditions that:

1.- The code does not change its name even if modified.

2.- Modifications of the code that are developed are made available to the CRPP.

3.- Results produced with the original or the modified versions of CHEASE should appropriately reference the original publications:

       H. Lütjens, A. Bondeson, O. Sauter, Comput. Phys. Commun. 97 (1996) 219

4.- CHEASE nor their progeny may be transferred or made available to other research groups without the written authorisation from the CRPP.
