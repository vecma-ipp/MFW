Build the Python High-level interface for the UAL with an empty back-end 
(equivalent of euitm_schemas only). Defines also a "ascii_cpo" module to 
read CPO data stored in ASCII files through cjk routines.

NOTE: this version is compatible with xsl transforms from UAL engine R2.3 
(with cython wrappers)


i) you can specify the install dir for the ual and ascii_cpo modules by:

 make INSTALL_DIR=<path to dir> install

   either it will be installed under a local python_pk directory.


ii) you can specify the version of the CPO XML description by specifying 
    as an additional argument:

 CPODEF=<name/path to the XML file containing the CPO description>



If installation is completed, set your PYTHONPATH env variable to the install
directory you choose (or to the default python_pk).
