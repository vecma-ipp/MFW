* Chease kernel is working now
	- issue with codeparams is fixed (using its own version of the XML parser => change in ual lib design)
* first test with chease 
	- with old codeparams it crash after 2 iterations => use updated xml/xsd from fc2k actor instead
	- with TAU=0.01 it finished a 0.5s run => but Te evo is bumping...
	- with TAU=0.005 it crashes mid-way (and chease has hard-time converging)
